    <h2><a id="about">What is the Flag Game?</a></h2>
    The Flag Fame is a small, 30 minute stand-alone game that helps introduce you and your class to the World Peace Game.  The purpose of the Flag Game is to help you, as the teacher, assess the feasibility of running the World Peace Game in your class.  You can read more about the World Peace Game and the Flag Game in the documents below.
    After playing the game, think about the following things: Were you comfortable giving up some control to your class?
    Were the students able to handle the responsibility?
    Do you think the World Peace Game is right for your class?
    Be sure to at least quickly browse the World Peace Game instructions before playing the Flag Game so you know what to look for.

    <h2><a id="instr">Conducting the Game</a></h2>
    Remember, it is important to step back from the game.  The role of the teacher is to facilitate the game, not to intervene.  The Flag Game is underspecified to give students a chance to work with each other and come up with solutions on their own. Leave most questions up to the color guard if possible.<br/>
    Before coming into class, make sure you've printed a set of objectives for every team regardless of which way you will be playing the game.

    In the future, this section will have pictures of our completed game with instructions on how to play it.
    That said I think our goal is to make the game playable without having to read any additional instructions beyond the design doc.<br/>
    To play the game on this website, you must have a projector and a computer that you can connect it to.<br/>
    To start a new game, aa;skjfs;alfjs; which will generate a new board.<br/>
    In the upper-right hand corner (or wherever), you'll see buttons that let you start the timer for the round structure.  You can skip remaining time on the click by pressing the "Advance" button.
    When time runs out, press the advance button to go on to the next stage.  Do not wait for all teams to be ready, as time pressure is part of the game.<br/>
    After a declaration passes, you can fill in the map by doing ####.  The game will then advance to the next team's turn.
