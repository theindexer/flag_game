    <h2><a id="about">What is the Flag Game?</a></h2>
    The Flag Fame is a small, 30 minute stand-alone game that helps introduce you and your class to the World Peace Game.  The purpose of the Flag Game is to help you, as the teacher, assess the feasibility of running the World Peace Game in your class.  You can read more about the World Peace Game and the Flag Game in the documents below.
    After playing the game, think about the following things: Were you comfortable giving up some control to your class?
    Were the students able to handle the responsibility?
    Do you think the World Peace Game is right for your class?
    Be sure to at least quickly browse the World Peace Game instructions before playing the Flag Game so you know what to look for.
    <h2><a id="docs">Useful Documents</a></h2>
    <a href="WPG-OverviewandDesign.pdf">World Peace Game Instructions</a> - If you'd like to know more about the World Peace Game, you can find an overview here.<br/>
    <a href="WPG-MiniGameDesignDoc.pdf">Flag Game Instructions</a> - This contains all the instructions for running the Flag Game, as well as all materials needed to play the game except for a flag.<br/>
    <a href="FlagGame2.pfg">Sample Flag</a> - This gameboard goes along with the objectives outlined in the Flag Game instructions.<br/>
    <h2><a id="instr">Additional Instructions</a></h2>
    There are two ways to run the flag game.  The first is to use this website to run the game.  After reading the instructions, you can hook up a computer to a projector and run the game on the <a href="index.html">main page</a>.  The game will help with timing rounds, generating boards, and filling in the flag.  It will also generate a list of objectives for each team.  You should use these objectives instead of the objectives provided in the instructions; print them out and distribute them like normal.<br/>
    The second way to run the game is to print out all the materials in the instructions and draw or project a flag (like the sample above).  The objectives provided in the instructions work with the sample flag provided.<br/>
    Either way, it is important to step back from the game.  The role of the teacher is to facilitate the game, not to intervene.  The Flag Game is underspecified to give students a chance to work with each other and come up with solutions on their own. Leave most questions up to the color guard if possible.<br/>
