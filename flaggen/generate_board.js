//Generate 17(?) random points
//Ideally use a seed such that specific boards are recoverable
//Compute Voronoi regions using Euclidean distance
//Create instance of polyclass for each region
//See source of www.contrib.andrew.cmu.edu/~saagars/ for Voronoi guidance
//(I can't actually do this yet, I realized I don't understand the current
// framework well enough to work in it (polyclass specifically)). Sorry, I suck.
